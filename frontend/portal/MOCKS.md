# Portal data layer — mock backend & handover

The portal is **mock-driven**. Every screen fetches real HTTP requests through a
thin typed API layer; in dev and Storybook those requests are intercepted by
[MSW](https://mswjs.io/) and answered with fixture data. Pointing the portal at a
**real backend** is a matter of *not registering MSW* — no component or API-layer
code changes.

The API layer calls the backend under `/api/v1/*` (the repo-wide convention). The
Stirling product API examples shown *inside* the portal UI — `/v1/extract`,
`/v1/invoice`, etc. — are a different surface (what customers call) and stay as-is.
In dev, `portal/vite.config.ts` proxies `/api` to the backend (default
`localhost:8080`, override with `BACKEND_URL`). Run both halves together with
**`task dev:portal`**, which spawns the backend and the portal on free ports and
wires the proxy automatically.

## Connecting to a self-hosted backend (auth)

Self-hosted is the active backend target today (`api/backendTarget.ts`). The
portal and the editor share one login: both send `credentials: "include"`, so a
single Stirling session cookie authenticates either app, and both bounce to the
same `/login` page on a 401. Whichever app you open first prompts the login;
after that the cookie covers both, so switching between them needs no re-login.
The server authorizes per request (an admin-only endpoint returns 403 to a
logged-in non-admin; that surfaces as an `HttpError`, not a login redirect).
There is no API key and no token to manage in the portal.

This is seamless when the portal and editor share an origin (prod: serve the
portal under the same host) or at least the same host (dev: cookies are
host-scoped, not port-scoped, so a `localhost:8080` login is sent to the
portal's dev port too). The login page lives in the editor, so in dev set
`VITE_PORTAL_LOGIN_URL` to the editor's `/login` (the portal has no login route
of its own). A cross-origin prod split additionally needs CORS with credentials
and a `SameSite=None` session cookie.

To test locally:

1. Run one backend with security enabled (`DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY=true`), JWT v2
   left off (the default; it is still under development).
2. Point both the editor and the portal at it (`BACKEND_URL=...`), and set the
   portal's `VITE_PORTAL_LOGIN_URL` to the editor's `/login`.
3. Turn mocks off. Opening either app redirects you to log in; once you do, both
   work as that admin.

Against an open dev backend (`DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY=false`) no 401 occurs and
requests succeed unauthenticated. SaaS (Supabase bearer) is wired as a second
target (`saasTarget`) for later.

## The three layers

```
view (useAsync)  ──►  api/<surface>.ts  ──►  httpJson(fetch)  ──►  MSW handler (dev)   ──►  fixture builder
                          (the contract)                          └► real backend (prod) ─┘
```

1. **`api/<surface>.ts`** — thin, typed `httpJson` wrappers. **This is the backend
   contract.** Each function documents its endpoint (method, path, query params)
   and its response type. Nothing else in the app issues fetches.
2. **`mocks/handlers/<surface>.ts`** — MSW handlers that answer those endpoints
   with `mocks/<surface>.ts` fixtures. Registered in `mocks/handlers/index.ts`.
3. **`mocks/<surface>.ts`** — fixture builders **and the canonical TS types**
   (re-exported through `api/<surface>.ts`, so consumers import types from `api/`).

`api/http.ts` is the single `fetch` wrapper (sets headers, throws `HttpError` on
non-2xx). Views consume via `useAsync()` + `useSectionFlags()` (`hooks/useAsync.ts`).

## Conventions (consistent across every surface)

- **Tier**: tier-specific endpoints take `?tier=free|pro|enterprise`. The view
  passes `useTier().tier` and refetches on change (`useAsync(fn, [tier])`).
- **Latency**: handlers `await delay(120)` to exercise loading/skeleton states.
- **Read-only today**: surfaces are GET-driven. The few writes (mark-all-read,
  op run) exist; composer "Deploy", connect-source wizard, and create-key are
  **demo shells** (local state, no submit endpoint yet) — wire these to real
  POSTs during backend integration.

## Swapping in a real backend

The proxy is already wired (`portal/vite.config.ts` forwards `/api` to
`BACKEND_URL`), so a surface goes live the moment its mock handler is gone. The
incremental, per-surface flow:

1. Implement the surface's `/api/v1/*` endpoint(s) on the backend, matching the
   response shapes in `api/<surface>.ts` (**the exported types are the spec**).
2. Remove that surface's handler from `mocks/handlers/index.ts`. MSW is started
   with `onUnhandledRequest: "bypass"`, so its now-unhandled `/api/v1/*` calls
   fall through to the proxy and hit the backend — every *other* surface keeps
   serving fixtures.
3. Once a surface is live, delete its `mocks/<surface>.ts` fixtures. Optionally
   relocate the types into `api/` (or a `types/` module) so they no longer live
   beside fixtures — purely cosmetic; the `api/` re-exports already shield consumers.

To flip **all** surfaces to the network at once (full live check), use the header
"Mocks" toggle — it persists the choice and reloads. Mocks default ON in dev / OFF
in production (`mocks/preference.ts`).
