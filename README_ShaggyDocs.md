## How to Run ShaggyDocs

To run ShaggyDocs on your computer, you'll need to have Java 17 installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Oracle website or use a package manager like Homebrew (on macOS) or Chocolatey (on Windows).

Once you have Java 17 installed, follow these steps:

1.  **Unzip the `ShaggyDocs.zip` file** to a location of your choice on your computer.
2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt** and navigate to the `Stirling-PDF` directory that you just unzipped.
3.  **Run the application** with the following command:

    ```bash
    java -jar ./app/core/build/libs/stirling-pdf-1.3.2.jar
    ```

4.  **Open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.

That's it! You should now see the ShaggyDocs interface, ready for you to use.

Enjoy!
