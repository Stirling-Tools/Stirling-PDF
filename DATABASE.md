# New Database Backup and Import Functionality

## Functionality Overview

The newly introduced feature enhances the application with robust database backup and import capabilities. This feature is designed to ensure data integrity and provide a straightforward way to manage database backups. Here's how it works:

1. Automatic Backup Creation
   - The system automatically creates a database backup every day at midnight. This ensures that there is always a recent backup available, minimizing the risk of data loss.
2. Manual Backup Export
   - Admin actions that modify the user database trigger a manual export of the database. This keeps the backup up-to-date with the latest changes and provides an extra layer of data security.
3. Importing Database Backups
   - Admin users can import a database backup either via the web interface or API endpoints. This allows for easy restoration of the database to a previous state in case of data corruption or other issues.
   - The import process ensures that the database structure and data are correctly restored, maintaining the integrity of the application.
4. Managing Backup Files
   - Admins can view a list of all existing backup files, along with their creation dates and sizes. This helps in managing storage and identifying the most recent or relevant backups.
   - Backup files can be downloaded for offline storage or transferred to other environments, providing flexibility in database management.
   - Unnecessary backup files can be deleted through the interface to free up storage space and maintain an organized backup directory.

## User Interface
