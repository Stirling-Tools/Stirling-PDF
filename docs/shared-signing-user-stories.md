# Shared Signing User Stories

- **As a document owner,** I can start a shared signing session by uploading a PDF, listing participant emails (with optional display names), adding a message or due date, and choosing whether to notify everyone immediately so that the collaboration is organized from the outset.
- **As a document owner,** I can retrieve a session to review its participants, share tokens, and current statuses so that I know who has been invited and who has responded.
- **As a document owner,** I can send reminder notifications to all participants or a selected subset with a custom message so that pending signers get nudged to complete their part.
- **As a participant,** I can attach my certificate materials (PEM key + certificate, PKCS#12/PFX, JKS, or the server certificate) along with signature placement details (page number, display name, reason, location, and logo/signature visibility) so that my signature is applied with the right credentials and appearance.
- **As a document owner,** I can finalize the session to apply every collected signature sequentially and download the fully signed PDF so that the collaboration produces a single completed document.
